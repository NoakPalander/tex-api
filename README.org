* Tex API
Creates a REST API for generating LaTex images given some mathematical string.

** Configuration
Configure ~priv/prod.env~ by setting the ~TEX_PORT~ to some port you desire to use.

** Building and Deploying
To build and deploy simply run
#+begin_src sh
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
#+end_src

This might take a while as we're using a Fedora image with ~texlive~.
